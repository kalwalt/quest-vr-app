# QuestVRAppExample

A very bad idea to create a VR App for Meta Quest with Capacitor; Android (Java) and Three.js. I leave this only for reference.
It worked running npm run dev and following the 192.168.1.x link in the Meta Browser. Now you can install the web app thanks to PWA.

## Future Works:
- deleting Android/Capacitor code
- adding more interactive stuff
